Trunk Recorder
=================

Trunk Recorder is able to record the calls on a trunked radio system. It uses 1 or more Software Defined Radios (SDRs) to do. The SDRs capture large swatches of RF and then use software to process what was recieved. GNURadio is used to do this processing and provides lots of convienent RF blocks that can be pieced together to do complex RF processing. Right now it can only record one Trunked System at a time.

Trunk Recorder currently supports the following:
 - P25 & SmartNet Trunking Systems
 - SDRs that use the OsmoSDR source ( HackRF, RTL - TV Dongles, BladeRF, and more)
 - Ettus USRP
 - P25 Phase 1 & Analog voice
 
I have tested things on both Unbuntu 14.04 & OSX 10.10. I have been using it with an Ettus b200, and a HackRF Jawbreaker.

##Compile

###Requirements
 - GNURadio 3.7
 - GR-DSD (The version I forked)
 - OP-25
  
**GNURadio**

It is important to have a very recent version of GnuRadio (GR). There was a bug in earlier versions that messed up the smartnet trunking. Make sure your install is up to date if you are having trouble deoding smartnet trunking.

If you are running Linux, the easiest way to install GR is by using [Pybombs](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/pybombs/wiki/QuickStart). After you have installed using pybombs, make sure you setup you Environment variables. In your pybombs directory, run: `./pybombs env` and then load them `source $prefix/setup_env.sh`, with $prefix being the directory you installed GR in.

If you are on OSX, the [MacPorts](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/MacInstall) install has worked for me.

**GR-DSD**

I made a fork of this code to allow for more statistics to be collected and the also make usre multiple copies can run at once. It has a few dependencies:
 - Lib Snd File: `sudo apt-get install libsndfile`
 - ITPP: `sudo apt-get install libitpp-dev`

Now download, compile and install the code. Make sure you have loaded the environment variables that point to the GR libaries first.
```
git clone https://github.com/robotastic/gr-dsd.git
cd gr-dsd
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/GR/install   .
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
Note - if you did not install GR in the standard spot, use the -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to point to it.

**OP25**

This should be as simple doing `./pybombs install gr-op25`. On OSX, it is quite a bit trickier. Right now the code is not patched for OSX installs. I will try to put together an easy way to do an OSX install in the future.

###Trunk Recorder
Okay, with that out of the way, here is how you compile Trunk Recorder:
```
git clone https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder.git
cd trunk-recorder
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/GR/install   .
make 
```
Hopefully this should compile with no errors.

##Configure
Configuring Trunk Recorder and getting things setup can be rather complex. I am looking to make things simpler in the future.

**config.json**

This file is used to configure how Trunk Recorder is setup. It defines the SDRs that are available and the trunk system that will be recorded. The following is an example for my local system in DC, using an Ettus B200:

```
{
    "sources": [{
        "center": 857000000.0,
        "rate": 8000000.0,
        "error": 0,
        "gain": 40,
        "antenna": "TX/RX",
        "digitalRecorders": 2,
        "driver": "usrp",
        "device": ""
    }],
    "system": {
        "control_channels": [854862500],
        "type": "smartnet"
    },
    "talkgroupsFile": "ChanList.csv"
}
```
Here are the different arguments:
 - **sources** - an array of JSON objects that define the different SDRs available and how to configure them
   - **center** - the center frequency in Hz to tune the SDR to
   - **rate** - the sampling rate to set the SDR to, in samples / second
   - **error** - the tuning error for the SDR in Hz. This is the difference between the target value and the actual value. So if you wanted to recv 856MHz but you had to tune your SDR to 855MHz to actually recieve it, you would set this to -1000000. You should also probably get a new SDR.
   - **gain** - the RF gain to set the SDR to. Use a program like GQRX to find a good value.
   - **ifGain** - [hackrf only] sets the ifgain.
   - **bbGain** - [hackrf only] sets the bbgain.
   - **antenna** - [usrp] lets you select which antenna jack to user on devices that support it
   - **digitalRecorders** - the number of Digital Recorders to have attached to this source. This is essentaully the number of simultanious call you can record at the same time in the frequency range that this SDR will be tuned to. It is limited by the CPU power of the machine. Some experimentation might be needed to find the appropriate number. It will use DSD or OP25 to decode the P25 CAI voice.
   - **analogRecorders** - the number of Analog Recorder to have attached to this source. This is the same as Digital Recorders except for Analog Voice channels.
   - **driver** - the GNURadio block you wish to use for the SDR. The options are *usrp* & *osmosdr*.
   - **device** - For RTL devices or other gr-osmosdr supported devices. For RTL use rtl="index number" or rtl="device serial number" (you can use rtl_eeprom in the rtl-sdr package to program RTL serial numbers)
 
*Note you can also add other gr-osmosdr settings such as buflen= which may be needed for multiple usb devices. (getting a good signal, lots of cpu power, but still gettings garbled voice only when using multiple usb devices)  config.json example:  device="rtl=0,buflen=2048"  or device="rtl=0,buffers=32,buflen=2048" buflen must be in multiples of 512. If you get any usb errors try unplugging your usb rtl devices and then retry after you plug them back in.  Your not limited to RTL settings you can use other settings that osmosdr supports for other devices I just use RTL as an example because it's the cheapest most common option. 

Check out http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/GrOsmoSDR for more information on supported devices and settings.

 
- **system** - This object defines the trunking system that will be recorded
   - **control_channels** - an array of the control channel frequencies for the system, in Hz. Right now, only the first value is used.
   - **type** - the type of trunking system. The options are *smartnet* & *p25*.
 - **talkgroupsFile** - this is a CSV file that provides information about the talkgroups. It determines whether a talkgroup is analog or digital, and what priority it should have. 

**ChanList.csv**

This file provides info on the different talkgroups in a trunking system. A lot of this info can be found on the Radio Reference website. You need to be a site member to download the table for your system. If you are not, try clicking on the "List All in one table" link, selecting everything in the table and copying it into Excel or a spreadsheet.

You will have to add an additional column that adds a priority for each talkgroup. You need that number of recorders available to record a call at that priority. So, 1 is the highest, you would need 2 recorders available to record a priority 2, 3 record for a priority 3 and so on.

The Trunk Record program really only uses the priority information and the Dec Talkgroup ID. The Website uses the same file though to help display information about each talkgroup.

Here are the column headers and some sample data:

| DEC |	HEX |	Mode |	Alpha Tag	| Description	| Tag |	Group | Priority |
|-----|-----|------|-----------|-------------|-----|-------|----------|
|101	| 065	| D	| DCFD 01 Disp	| 01 Dispatch |	Fire Dispatch |	Fire | 1 |
|2227 |	8b3	| D	| DC StcarYard	| Streetcar Yard |	Transportation |	Services | 3 | 


###How Trunking Works
Here is a little background on trunking radio systems, for those not familiar. In a Trunking system, one of the radio channels is set aside for to manage the assignment of radio channels to talkgroups. When someone wants to talk, they send a message on the control channel. The system then assigns them a channel and sends a Channel Grant message on the control channel. This lets the talker know what channel to transmit on and anyone who is a member of the talkgroup know that they should listen to that channel.

In order to follow all of the transmissions, this system constantly listens to and decodes the control channel. When a channel is granted to a talkgroup, the system creates a monitoring process. This process will start to process and decode the part of the radio spectrum for that channel which the SDR is already pulling in.

No message is transmitted on the control channel when a talkgroupâ€™s conversation is over. So instead the monitoring process keeps track of transmissions and if there has been no activity for 5 seconds, it ends the recording.
